      Use the responsive .row-cols-* classes to quickly set the number of columns that best render your content and layout. Whereas normal .col-* classes apply to the individual columns (e.g., .col-md-4), the row columns classes are set on the parent .row as a default for contained columns. With .row-cols-auto you can give the columns their natural width.

Use these row columns classes to quickly create basic grid layouts or to control your card layouts and override when needed at the column level.
